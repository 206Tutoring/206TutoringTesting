<b><font color="#000000" style="font-size:18px">SERVICES OFFERED</font></b>
<br><br>    
— <i><b>Short consultations</i></b> where I point you or your high-schooler in the right direction for college applications.<br>
    — <i><b>Longer programs</i></b> where I supervise whichever parts of the application process you'd like me to, ranging from finding schools to editing essays to negotiating the final stages of applications.
<br><br>
<font color="#000000" style="font-size:18px"><b>COLLEGE COUNSELING FROM WHITMAN TO WASHINGTON TO WESLEYAN</font></b><br><br>
I grew up in Seattle and went east for College, graduating from Columbia in 2009. In New York, I found, college admissions had become extremely corporate, and the extortionary costs put all kids, <i>even wealthy kids</i>, under huge amounts of stress — if you’re having that much spent on you, the thought process goes, <i>you better get in</i>.
<br><br>
<i>My college counseling is in opposition to that</i>. I don’t put demands upon my students’ time — <b>I free it up</b>. I don’t tell my students that they “have to go to Harvard” or go “Yale or bust” — I show them that <b>there are many places they’d be happy</b>, and those may simply be two of them. I don’t tell them there’s only one way to write an essay or fill out an app — I show them how to fit the form into their own lives, and familiarize them with concepts like sample size and variance that <i>will keep them in good stead beyond college and into adult life</i>.
<br><br>
<b>Here’s what I bring to the table:</b>
<br><br>
— Admission to Columbia from public high school, with a minimum of test prep and college counseling<br>
— Keeping in touch with friends, and visiting them at their high schools and colleges from LA to Boston<br>
— Five years experience as an editor; published author with exceptional writing skills<br>
<br>
<b>Here’s why that bests what my competitors have to offer:</b>
<br><br>
— Younger age (26) and peer group gives me far greater insight into the modern college-admissions process than older counselors<br>
— Less entrenchment means my perspective is fresher and unencumbered by market dependence<br>
— Less boosterism for universities; more realistic, less PR-style appraisals of colleges and college life<br>
<br>
<b>Here’s some topics we’ll cover to help you narrow down your search</b>:
<br><br>
— Scholarships / "bubbling for dollars"<br>
— Why rankings aren’t all that relevant, except for that other people think they are<br>
— Liberal-arts vs. small university vs. large university<br>
— The ‘rule of first impressions’<br>
— Keeping your options open within the school<br>
— Keeping your options open for all schools<br>
— ‘Bubbling for dollars’ and other ways to reduce cost<br>
— Prestige’s upsides and downsides<br>
— Why the East Coast is so alluring<br>
— On-campus vs. off-campus life<br>
— Why your intended major doesn’t matter much<br>
<br>
<b>Finally, here’s how we’ll take your application from “barely started” to “accepted”</b>:<br>
<br>
— Finishing applications efficiently and quickly<br>
— Early-decision vs. early-action<br>
— Essay-writing and essay-editing for hassled and overworked teens<br>
— Getting through applications, one at a time, over the course of a few months<br>
— Why to apply to the UW in addition to Harvard, so to speak<br>
— Primary sources on college admissions from <i>Slate</i>, <i>Salon</i>, the <i>New York Times</i>, the <i>New Yorker</i>, and more<br>
— Troubleshooting stress<br>
<br>
Every college applicant deserves to feel like they've done all they can to maximize their chances. Don't negotiate this critical juncture alone — make the journey with someone who's been through it dozens of times! Call, text, or e-mail me.<br><br>
<b><i>Rates available upon request.</b></i>

<i>Chris and I worked together for a few hours last year. His college counseling is worth it for the reassurance alone.</i><br>
<div align="right">- Britt T., Seattle</div><br><br>
<i>I don’t know if Chris got my son into Whitman, but he definitely helped. High school can be so competitive. We appreciated the helping hand.</i><br>
<div align="right">- Carl M., Bellevue</div><br><br>
<i>My family couldn’t pay for the kind of college counseling I was told about at [my school], until I told them to get on Craigslist and start looking. Now, with my scholarship, they can pay for Columbia.
</i><br>
<div align="right">- Payal A., Seattle</div><br><br>
<i>Chris did a good job of meeting me halfway, encouraging me to apply to the colleges I was already interested in, and telling me about a few more I’d never heard of. I’m now going to one of the latter and am so glad I booked a few hours with Chris!
