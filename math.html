<br><br>  
    — <i><b>One-on-one math tutoring</i></b> from basic arithmetic to high-school calculus, encompassing homework maintenance, real-world enrichment, additional practice, or any of the above<br>
— <b><i>Small-group math classes</i></b> at my home with the same range of method and subject matter<br>
    — <b><i>Small-group math classes</i></b> with low per-student rates, wherever convenient for your group<br>

<b><font color="#000000" style="font-size:18px">HOW AND WHY I TEACH MATH</font></b>
<br><br>
<b>I can teach you a year’s worth of math in under ten hours</b>. Here’s how:
<br><br>
Math is the subject <b>taught worst in school</b>. I strongly believe this is due to math being approached as a series of arbitrary and unrelated formulas and theorems, to be committed rotely to memory. In reality, it is the <b>study of patterns</b> that relate to one another and every other subject. Most recently printed math books have little merit, beyond being brightly colored; they succeed at confusing and discouraging even brilliant students, which is a shame, as (and this is true for math more so than any other subject) nearly every math <b>class could be aced</b> by a majority of students. 
<br><br>
I would like to prove this to you! My students deserve to understand math <b>efficiently and comprehensively</b>, so that math class is not a cause for anxiety and frustration, but <b>confidence and discovery</b>. My teaching method starts at the beginning and works its way up, speedily and conceptually, to whatever material the teacher covering (or would like to cover). This way, the current material is more deeply understood, previous topics will become harder to forget, and upcoming topics will be swiftly grasped. 
<br><br>
In contrast to English classes, most math classes consist of <b>no more than 20 concepts</b> for an entire year; I can cover that much material in <b>no longer than 10 hours</b>. A chapter review should take little more than one hour. I'm proficient in the use of a graphing calculator and other labor-saving devices, and I can present strategies for coping with inordinate homework loads and the other stresses of being a secondary-school student. 
<br><br>
<b><font color="#000000" style="font-size:18px">MATH ACCOMPLISHMENTS</font></b>
<br><br>
- In middle school, I was a ‘mathlete,’ at Washington; in 2000, <b>I won a state championship at competitive math</b>, and in 2001, I won a trip to Chicago as part of the MATHCOUNTS program. 
<br><br>
- In high school, I was <b>three years ahead in math</b>, finishing AP Calculus AB as a sophomore, AP Statistics as a junior, and AP Calculus BC as a senior. I scored a 5 on each of those AP tests. 
<br><br>
- At Columbia, I completed coursework in <b>multivariable calculus</b>. 
<br><br>
- <b>My SAT math score was 800</b>. For test prep, I am the best value in town; if you can find a group class that’s cheaper, I can <b>match that rate</b>, while giving much more individual attention so that a lesser time investment brings about greater improvements. 
<br><br>
- I played poker professionally from 2010 to 2011. Poker is primarily a math-based game, and the kind of thought processes it promotes — 'fuzzy math' or 'number sense' — are the type of math I've find most applicable to real-world situations, in everything from <b>music theory</b> to <b>high-paying computer-science jobs</b>. 
<br><br>
- If you’re also interested in <a href="http://www.206tutoring.com/piano.html">piano lessons</a>, I have a strong intuitive grasp of music theory, which is also very math-based. 
<br><br>
<b><font color="#000000" style="font-size:18px">TEACHING QUALIFICATIONS</font></b>
<br><br>
- In 2007, I tutored students from <b>ages 8 to 18</b> in math subjects ranging from <b>Beginning Algebra to AP Calculus BC</b>. I'm an alumnus of Garfield and Columbia, so I'm very good at teaching students of varying backgrounds, circumstances, and ability levels, and getting them to where they want to be. 
<br><br>
- In 2007 and 2008, I was an intern for <a href="http://www.kineticbooks.com">Kinetic Books</a>, developers of non-traditional and extremely effective online Math books; from 2011 to 2012, I worked for them full-time, as a proofreader, content editor, and software tester. 
<br><br>
- I <b>taught poker</b>, too. Over Skype, from 2011 to 2012, I helped students from across the globe learn to profit from that math- and psychology-based game. I'm therefore particularly strong in statistics, and the connection between math, games, bias, and other academic subjects. 
<br><br>
I'm happy to <b>travel to you</b>; it’s part of the job. 
<br><br>
Discounts are available for purchases of five hours or more.

<b><font color="#000000" style="font-size:18px">TESTIMONIALS</font></b><br><br>
<i>CML has the right idea about math. My lucrative career as an actuary blossomed from a deep understanding of mathematics, a deep understanding that CML demonstrates consistently. I can remember when math finally 'clicked' for me. I remember feeling so much regret at all the wasted time and emotion I had spent struggling in math courses up until that point. It can be so much easier. Anyone considering tutoring should definitely take the plunge. This guy gets it.</i><br>
<div align="right">— Mark Southworth, Actuary for <a href="http://us.milliman.com" style="text-decoration:none">Milliman</a></div><br>
<i>Excellent math tutor for material all the way up through the end of pre-calculus. My daughter raised her grade and had more time to devote to her extracurriculars.</i><br>
<div align="right">— John C., Bellevue</div><br>
    <i>My teenage son praised Chris’s ability to bring him up to speed with only one hour per week — he no longer dreads going to math class.</i><br>
<div align="right">— Alvin L., Seattle</div><br>
    <i>CML is very funny. I wish more math tutors were like that.</i><br>
    <div align="right">- Richard N., Kirkland</div><br>
    <i>Christopher is one of the brightest students that I ever taught. He's always been very special to me. His understanding of mathematics and his ability to relate this to others is first-rate. If CML wasn't already aware how little a teacher earns, I'd encourage him to major in education.</i><br>
