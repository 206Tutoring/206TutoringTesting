<b><font color="#000000" style="font-size:18px">THE KINDS OF ENGLISH, READING, AND WRITING LESSONS I GIVE</font></b>
<br><br>
In school I was always told that ‘everyone needs math,’ and, though this is true, <b>everyone needs reading and writing far more</b>. With the rise of the Internet, the increasing difficulty and subjectivity of <b>college admissions</b>, and the competition for scarce jobs hinging on résumés, interviews, and communication skills, your proficiency in reading and writing is more critical than ever before. 
<br><br>
<b>Reading well is essential to living well</b>. Reading for school can be tedious, but I can help you do it more quickly and with greater understanding and memory, by discovering how it relates to other school subjects and your life. Metaphors like ‘reading the situation’ or ‘hand-reading’ or 'reading music’ or ‘mixed messages’ are no accident; good reading is inseparable from good judgment. Improving your language skills will also improve your thought processes. As a literature student at Columbia, I chewed through a big chunk of the Western canon, so I see reading and writing as a <b>shortcut and aid to human experience</b>. 
<br><br>
<b>Writing and reading well are marketable skills</b>. The SAT, ACT, and GRE all have some reading and writing components, as do most college and job applications. Fastidious reading comprehension and clear expression of ideas will <b>make you look smart</b>, and will empower you to excel in any private, public, or social situation, while granting you educational and economic opportunities for the rest of your life. 
<br><br>
Not only will reading and writing well make you look smart, <b>they’ll actually make you smarter</b>. Reading well will let you make connections between seemingly dissimilar ideas, allowing you to discern patterns in people's behavior while avoiding making the same mistake twice. An expansive vocabulary will enable you to call things what they are. I could keep going, but I can also teach you brevity! 
<br><br>
<b><font color="#000000" style="font-size:18px">QUALIFICATIONS AS A WRITER AND READER</font></b>
<br><br>
- At Garfield, I was a popular columnist for the award-winning Messenger, and was voted 'Best Writer' in the senior poll. At Columbia, I wrote somewhere around fifty articles for a handful of publications, and was twice a columnist for the infamous Columbia Daily Spectator. 
<br><br>
- On the SAT, I scored a <b>800</b> in Verbal, and a <b>770</b> in Writing. 
<br><br>
- I've written for, and been paid by, several different websites on topics ranging from modern TV to old literature and card games. Google me! 
<br><br>
- <b>I've written two novels and two screenplays</b>, and it's my hope that one of each of those is respectively published and produced by the end of 2014. 
<br><br>
<b><font color="#000000" style="font-size:18px">QUALIFICATIONS FOR TEACHING ENGLISH</font></b>
<br><br>
- <b>I was an English literature student at Columbia</b>. I read and write compulsively. 
<br><br>
- I've got a ton of <b>prior experience</b>. I tutored writing in 2007 to students ages 9 to 18, and was a content editor and proofreader for a boutique educational-software firm in 2007, 2008, and 2011-2012. I've been a member of three writing groups, and have edited and copy-edited for each of the publications I've worked on. 
<br><br>
- My writing experience is in a <b>wide range of disciplines</b>, so (though I only know English) I've achieved mastery of many of its idioms — academic writing, screenwriting, novelistic prose, poetry, technical writing, and so on. I can help you express yourself in language appropriate for the situation, and I can help them wield these powerful idioms, as well as understanding the implications for using one kind of language over another, and mixing these idioms to create your own meaning. 
<br><br>
- Much of my teaching experience has been with <b>foreign students</b>, so I'm well-versed in <b>teaching ESL learners</b>, as well as teaching native speakers how to express themselves clearly to ESL learners. 
<br><br>
- I have an <b>enormous vocabulary</b>, making me an ideal choice for conquering the Verbal section of standardized tests. Though there's no way to get around a little rote memorization for these sections, I can at the very least put those words into context, bringing them to life, making them more resonant and <b>far easier to remember</b>. 
<br><br>
<b>I'm happy to travel to you</b>; it’s part of the job. 
<br><br>
<b>Discounts are available</b> for purchases of five hours or more.

<i>I was lucky enough to be CML's journalism teacher in high school. I got to know him as a remarkably talented writer and, more importantly, a good man. Also, he's a really funny guy—he knows how to make learning fun.

<i>Chris helped my daughter get through a difficult class with a teacher she didn’t get along with. She’s now using that experience as a template for both getting through more classes like that, and writing difficult essays that used to cause her lots of sleepless nights.</i><br><div align="right">- Stephen D., Renton</div><br>
