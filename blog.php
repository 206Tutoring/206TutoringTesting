					<p><span class="intro">Large institutions like Kaplan and the Princeton Review</span> are known for charging students a lot and paying their tutors little, but I’d argue the worst thing about them is that they waste a student’s time—this is almost a foregone conclusion in a classroom setting, where you end up bored if you’re ahead of the teacher’s pace, and confused if you’re behind it. They are heavily invested in only helping students to the extent that they’ll be not quite discouraged enough by slight improvement to come back and take another test. Worst of all, they only use their own materials—often riddled with discouraging errors.</p>
					<p>By contrast, my approach to test prep integrates the best materials on the market. We might use the SAT Blue Book for practice material, the Up Your Score guide for introducing concepts, and other secondary sources to address lingering difficulties.</p>
					<p class="stacked-p">Here’s a typical assignment, given in the middle of the week to an over-the-summer student studying the SAT:</p>
					<p>
						—Study the tone words: P. 157 of the Up Your Score SAT guide.<br>
						—Familiarize yourself with the writing rules: P. 249 of the UYS guide. Try to find specific examples of each while you’re doing the writing test (especially the underlined correction question types), plus prepositions.<br>
						—Finish one or two of the reading sections and the writing sections for Practice Test #1 in the SAT Blue Book. Time yourself, but take your time. Accuracy is much more important than speed at this point.<br>
						—Read about roots in the Kaplan GRE book, then go through a vocab test.<br>
						—Read twenty pages of a novel of your choice, and note and learn all the vocabulary words you don’t know.<br>
						—Have fun!<br>

				<h1>Some Thoughts on Jean Anyon</h1>
				<!-- AUTHOR + DATE -->
				<h3>By Chris Morris-Lent</h3>
				<!-- IMAGE FILE PATH -->
				<img src="/assets/test_prep/Test_prep_ACT.png" alt="Books">
				<section class="blog-paragraph">
					<!-- FIRST PARAGRAPH -->
					<p><span class="intro">Education is such a central theme of Western literature and philosophy,</span> and so steeped in tradition, that we often forget productive and valuable research on the topic is happening all the time. Jean Anyon’s article on the differing methods used to teach different social classes of public schools is incredibly interesting and very applicable to the lives of anyone who is or knows a student.</p>
					<p>Here are some of my thoughts on it:</p>
					<p>Page 69: The methodology of rating teachers as “excellent according to the principal” is the opposite of what you want to do, because if there’s anyone who doesn’t know how to assess a teacher, it’s the teacher’s own principal.</p>
					<p>Page 70: Capital is about relationships between people, which is a clear impetus for diversity in education, as well as education in general — the good relationships kids develop with their peers should be positive enough to drown out the horrible ones they have with their authority figures.</p>
					<p>Page 71: Philip Roth’s novels, set in the Newark Jewish ghetto, often focus on education; the kids are poor, but their schooling and class are mad bourgeois.</p>
					<p>Page 77:  The description of the poor school is really depressing. The realities of school have desensitized us to cruelty to children. Still not sure if the “class” issues are entirely at fault, though, as this kind of education is described by Orwell in “Such, Such Were the Joys,” at a boarding school that was upper- to upper-middle-class.</p>
					<p>Page 79: Reading about the extra creativity in the “Affluent Professional School,” closest to my privileged magnet program of APP in its demographics, I remember this contradiction. For all my schooling through fifth grade every class was orderly, every teacher respected, miscreants swiftly dealt with, and so on. I have a strong memory of the first day of math class in sixth grade at Washington Middle School: an old and ineffectual “teacher”; a madhouse. I had none of the skills to deal with it: my education had isolated me from the world, yet it is claimed here (and probably correct) that the lower-class kind of education has the same effect, but worse: they’re stuck in their own class/class, and I in my wealthier ones. Education, I think, should do the opposite — it should enable you to deal with and fit into as many situations as possible. At the time the crazy classroom and overrun teacher stressed me out, but in retrospect it was one of my best educational experiences: learning, little by little, to not care about the things that didn’t matter.</p>
					<p>Page 89: “The executive elite school gives its children something that none of the other schools does: knowledge of and practice in manipulating the socially legitimated tools of analysis of systems.” This is, or should be, the highest goal of education! But only someone wealthy and oblivious could ever miss the idea that school is bunk and adults are liars. All the poor kids know this and always have. But what can they do about it?</p>

					<p><span class="intro">My main talent in life is writing,</span> but it wasn’t until I left high school I discovered I loved reading. The high-school syllabi, full of boring books, were partially to blame, but I mainly blame the teaching—my ninth-grade English teacher couldn’t even relate Romeo and Juliet to a bunch of hormonal, dramatic, moody teenagers!
