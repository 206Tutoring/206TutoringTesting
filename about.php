			<h1>Mission Statement</h1>
			<p>The approach to education in 21st-century America results too often in anxiety, frustration and stress. Too many tutors exacerbate these stresses by promoting or profiting from a high-stakes environment: assigning homework or worksheets of their own, demanding the wrong things of their students, or otherwise misunderstanding their role.</p>
			<p class="italic">The way we see it, our job is the opposite of that.</p>
			<p>206 Tutoring exists because we want to work against the worst aspects of school (and music lessons), and embody the best ones.</p>
			<p>We teach to make learning more worthwhile and more fun for our students.</p>
			<p>We tutor to <span class="italic">relieve</span> anxiety and frustration and stress.</p>
			<p>We tutor to help our students spend <span class="italic">less</span> time on homework, and more time on the things they love to do.</p>
      <p>
        We promote a relaxing and comfortable environment. We encourage our
        students to ask questions about the material and their interests. We cultivate
        a disposition for curiosity.
      </p>
      <p>
Working with 206 Tutoring, students feel like themselves, can put each difficulty in the right context, and focus on solving it.
