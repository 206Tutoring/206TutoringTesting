<b><font color="#000000" style="font-size:18px">SERVICES OFFERED</font></b>
<br><br>    
— <i><b>Eight-week classes in writing for publication</i></b>, where I'll take your existing pieces and help you interest the world in them!<br>
— <i><b>Individual consulting</b></i> to the same end.
<br><br>
<font color="#000000" style="font-size:18px"><b>FROM THE BEGINNING TO ...</font></b><br><br>
I’m a writer. When I was a student, I couldn’t help but get published – I learned to write for an audience on the Garfield HS <i>Messenger</i>, and honed my skills further as a staff writer and columnist for the Columbia <i>Spectator</i> and its literary-magazine sister publication.<br><br> <i>But when I graduated, everything dried up.</i> This is a common experience! I eventually realized that this was because everyone in the real world was a "writer," and that I couldn’t do without the self-promotion that was so unnatural and difficult for me. It took me some time to figure out how to deal with it, during which my creativity suffered. Whether you’re a housewife, a CEO, a self-employed creative type, or all of the above, I want to help you avoid the same, and have your writing <i>get the attention it ought to be getting</i>. That’s why I’ve started Classes in Writing for Publication!<br><br>
<b>My credentials:</b><br><br>
— I’ve written and iterated several long-form projects, including a 250-page novel, and have published hundreds of articles from New York literary magazines to online hobby sites that gross seven figures.<br>
— As an undergraduate, I interned for the <i>Columbia Journalism Review</i> and conducted literary research for C. David Heymann, an author of popular biographies, in addition to working as a columnist on the campus daily, serving as a copy-editor for a literary magazine, and a handful of other, smaller obligations.<br>
— I maintain dozens of contacts in the publishing, magazine, and newspaper industries, whose advice I am happy to draw upon and feature over the course of my class!<br>
— After college, I dedicated myself to longer projects, but have recently been paid to write regularly for two large and profitable websites.
<br><br>
<b>Ideal for:</b><br><br>
— Recent university graduates who find themselves struggling to write or write for publication after college<br>
— Professionals who want to improve their style and confidence for official communiqués, etc.<br>
— Writers, bloggers, Tweeters, et al. who want to expand their Internet audience<br>
— Anyone who wants to come out and meet more interesting people!
<br><br>
<b>Topics include:</b><br><br>
— Tooting your own horn — I know a lot of creative minds find this distasteful, or at least difficult, and I completely understand. <i>I can help.</i> Between my contacts in the publishing industry and my experience getting high-schoolers to write college essays, <i>I know why it’s hard</i>, and <i>I know what works</i>.<br>
— Editing, but not overediting, to fit the tone of your target publication<br>
— Using social media, as well as the appropriate online advertising, to promote yourself<br>
— Developing contacts who can help get you what you want, even if you dislike them<br>
— The compromise implicit in all individualism
<br><br>
<b>Group classes:</b><br><br>
— Meet at my house, in Northeast Seattle, for two hours, on weeknights, once a week for ten weeks<br>
— Will teach you how to get the word out<br>
— Are affordable and suitable for all ages<br>
— Feature guest speakers from Amazon, HarperCollins, and more<br>
— Have wine and canapes!
<br><br>
<b><i>Rates available upon request.</b></i>
<br><br><font color="#000000" style="font-size:18px"><b>TESTIMONIALS</font></b><br><br>
<i>I started my website five years ago, and for four years only my family and a few others would stop by, no matter how much time I put into it. I took Chris’s writing class and have met a lot of friends — both from the class itself, and the connections I’ve made afterwards.</i><br>
<div align="right">- Sharon K., Woodinville</div><br><br>
<i>Some of us — myself included — write, and have always written, but need that extra little bit of confidence to get ourselves out there. Chris’s class was a good first step for me, and the wine was a good second step. Now I’ve gotten to see my words in print — there didn’t have to be a third step!</i><br>
<div align="right">- John F., Seattle</div><br><br>
<i>I’ve known Chris for over ten years. He is an exceptional writer, and (as a writer myself) I am happy to see him offering these classes. Self-promotion and commercialization have always been some of the most difficult parts of the creative process, because they seem so at odds with the nature of writing, and the temperament it requires. Chris will help you get over that hump. He gets it.

<i>A fun and informative class.
