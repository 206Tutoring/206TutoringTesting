Poker is the best game ever conceived — maybe the perfect game — and I want to share its resonant life lessons and lucrativeness with as many people as possible.<br><br>

Until the pointless tragedy of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Scheinberg" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none">Black Friday</a> made it nearly impossible to play online poker in ‘the land of the free,’ I played professionally; as I write this, two and a half years later, I’ve had to change my primary source of income, but I’m still <b>passionately dedicated to teaching poker</b>. I have kept in touch with several of my former students, as well as the evolution of the game over the last two and a half years. <br><br>

I’m therefore happy to offer coaching services in a variety of formats, both <b>live and online</b>, for a <b>reduced rate</b>! <br><br>

Online, I specialize in instructing <b>low-stakes Multi-Table Tournament grinders</b>. Live, I can give instruction in cash stakes up to <b>$5/$10</b>, and tournaments with buy-ins up to <b>$1500</b>. In both cases, I bring expertise in other areas of tournament poker, as well as extensive experience in playing <b>other games</b> and teaching <b>other subjects</b>, to the table.<br><br>

My <b>qualifications as a player</b> include:<br><br>

- <b>Success</b> in MTTs over a <b>significant sample</b>. I was particularly strong at <b>Pot-Limit Omaha</b> and <b>Pot-Limit Omaha Hi-Lo</b> tournaments. You can see <a href="http://www.officialpokerrankings.com/pokerstars/cmlisawesome/poker/results/1E53651CFE2A49C7911EB83A4D10DBAE.html?t=2" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none">my stats</a> online.<br><br>


- I have a <b>World Championship of Online Poker final table</b> and several substantial scores under my belt. In June 2010, I chopped the PokerStars nightly $11 rebuy for <b>$8,000</b>, and I have wins in the Full Tilt Super Turbo $117 and the Full Tilt $55 FO for <b>$7,000</b> each, as well as 4th place in the WCOOP $215 PLO for <a href="http://en.pokerprolabs.com/topsharkpro/tourneys?nid=7A5D0B4BA87333B71670B45B98E330CFB8C69267A2EDFC9A488BEF2A3522865Bl" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none">$28,750</a>. <br><Br>

- In smaller tournaments, I averaged $3 a game over 3000+ games of 12-dollar, 180-man Sit-’n’-Gos. (Though the online game has changed significantly since then, the most money in those games is made evaluating your own hand strength with respect to your position and stack size, and those evaluations have changed little — a big blind is still a big blind, and a dollar is still a dollar!) <br><br>


- In live poker, I’m a veteran of countless profitable cash sessions at casinos from Snoqualmie to Vegas. That game has barely changed at all, and I can teach you timeless techniques for bilking recreational players out of as much money as possible.<br><br>

My <b>qualifications as a coach</b> include:<br><br>


- <b>Experience coaching poker</b>. This includes mentoring several 180 regs for free under twoplustwo.com’s old Small-Stakes MTT mentee / mentor program, most of whose games have drastically improved under me. I also used to instruct a stable of $2/180 and $12/180 professionals weekly.<br><br>



- <b>Experience being coached in poker</b>. My methodology is broad and adapted from the several coaches I've had. Online, we'll do live sweats as well as hand history reviews, using some combination of PokerXFactor, Skype, and TeamViewer, and I will also point you in the direction of other resources to help improve your game. Live, I’ll watch you play and offer analyses of your tougher hands, which will give you all at once the experience and thought processes needed to improve.<br><br>



- <b>Experience playing other games</b>. I’ve always been a gamer; over the years, I’ve played Starcraft, Starcraft II, Scrabble, Magic, and chess, to some mastery, and I’m greatly fascinated by the creative connections between these games; the extra context and comparisons and shared skills between these games bring about can make you a better poker player!<br><br>



- <b>Experience teaching other subjects</b>. As I also teach English, math, piano, and do test prep, I’ve worked with a broad variety of learning styles. When I tutor school subjects, I’ve noticed that school is more of an emotional difficulty than an intellectual difficulty, and I’ve been continually amazed at what excellent results teaching kids to feel better about themselves and admit that it’s OK to be wrong sometimes brings about. In poker, this is <b>even truer</b>, and my coaching sessions will help you cope with the stress and emotional swings that are inseparable from poker, turning these emotions into a <b>tool to help you play better</b>. With my experience in games and teaching, I can help you figure out what you want out of poker, and I can also help you determine the best way to fit that into what you want out of life.<br><br>



- <b>Unbeatable rate</b>. The cheapest poker lessons elsewhere go for $50 an hour. <b>For poker only</b>, I’m happy to offer a <b>new student special</b> — buy one hour, get another hour free! This can be a hand history review, or a sweat session, or both; an online lesson, a live lesson, or both — it’s completely up to you!<br><br>



As in all other subjects, <b>discounts are available</b> for bulk purchases. A few hours of live instruction, at your home, or in the casino, should be more than enough to have you <b>crushing the games</b> at either. A few hours of online instruction won’t go quite as far, as games online are more difficult, but will still be an excellent use of your time as a professional or hobbyist, especially if you’re looking to play small- to mid-stakes tournaments profitably.<br><br> 



If all education is an investment, <b>poker coaching is an investment that pays off quickly</b>. It’s also fun as hell ;)

<i>I’ve known Chris for about 3 years now, and he’s helped me a lot as I’ve grown as a player. He really knows his stuff and is very nice, in fact so nice that we’ve become really good friends and discuss hands and so on, for free, on a regular basis. He’s always ready to listen and help. By all means get him while you can, because there aren't many teachers out there like Chris. He will immediately introduce you to ranges and plug your basic leaks. You will feel like a million bucks after you’re done with him and will start to play better right away. I’ve even had him start teaching my girlfriend!</i><br>
