    — <i><b>GRE, SAT, and ACT lessons</i></b> that will often dramatically improve your score, in the following formats:<br>
    — <i><b>Individual lessons here</i></b> – a short course of one-on-one tutoring in or around my teaching space in Northeast Seattle<br>
    — <i><b>Group lessons here</i></b> – a set-schedule course (once a week, on weeknights) in or around my teaching space in Northeast Seattle<br>
    — <i><b>Group lessons there</i></b> – an on-demand course for 3 to 12 students, held however frequently you like, wherever you like!<br><br>
<font color="#000000" style="font-size:18px"><b>THE MOST PAINLESS KIND OF TEST PREP</font></b>
<br><br>
Education is no longer a means for upward social mobility; it is now almost a prerequisite. We’d like to to measure the value of our own education in friends and memories made, and the most fun I have with this job is teaching English, math, and piano with personal growth in mind. However, the <b>college-admissions process</b> and the <b>job market</b> tend to take a less holistic view of things. So test prep becomes necessary.
<br><br>
I can teach most tests, <b>especially the SAT and ACT</b>, efficiently and effectively. My lessons are a better product than my competitors offer due to <i>lower rates</i>, <i>individual attention</i>, and my exceptional test scores, far above what you'll get at Kaplan or the Princeton Review.
<br><br>
At any rate, though test-taking is unpleasant, challenging, and only a means to an end, these ends — an <b>ideal college experience</b> (or at least a college experience of one's choice), getting into a <b>professional or graduate program</b>, obtaining a lucrative and challenging job</b> — are worthwhile enough that test-prep is one of the easiest and cheapest investments you can make. 
<br><br>
I’m confident that I can offer a very good return on this investment. For a little time and money, I can teach most anyone <b>how to master the SAT, ACT, GRE, or a handful of assorted AP Tests</b>, enabling everyone to devote themselves to happy and successful lives during, before, and after the tests. Because of the <b>one-on-one</b> nature of my tutoring business, and the absence of a middleman and rigid curricula, my sessions are a <b>better value</b> than any test-prep agency. 
<br><br>
<font color="#000000" style="font-size:18px"><b>MY TEST-TAKING TRACK RECORD</font></b>
<br><br>
- My <b>SAT scores</b> were <b>800</b> in Math, <b>800</b> in Reading, and <b>770</b> in Writing. This is well above the standard for a Princeton Review instructor, who need only score 700 when he starts teaching, and that for a Kaplan instructor. As someone who took the SAT twice — the format changed my senior year of high school — as well as an older sibling and educator of seven years’ experience, I’m well aware of what’s changed on the SAT, and what’s stayed the same.
<br><br>
- My <b>GRE scores</b> were <b>800</b> in Verbal and <b>790</b> in Math (1590 translates to 339 using the current scoring scale.) The GRE and the SAT, in spite of their recent ‘overhauls,’ are still the old school of standardized tests that were developed prior to the emergence of the test-prep industry, and can thus be prepared for and mastered in the same efficient way. 
<br><br>
- <b>I got 5’s on the AP US History, Calculus AB, Calculus BC, and Statistics tests</b>, and 4’s on the English Language and Composition and European History tests. Due to my coursework at Columbia and my 15 years of playing the piano, I also teach the <b>Music Theory</b> test. For the history and English exams, I am deeply familiar with the AP ‘formula’ to (pretend to) assess quality of writing, and thus can offer general skills for conquering future tests inside and outside the AP. 
<br><br>
- Though I never took the <b>ACT</b>, I have ample <b>experience teaching the ACT</b> and am well-apprised of the differences and similarities between it and the SAT/GRE. My students have made comparable gains on both the ACT and the SAT.
<br><br>
<font color="#000000" style="font-size:18px"><b>TEACHING QUALIFICATIONS</font></b>
<br><br>
- As a student and educator, I’ve taken hundreds (if not thousands) of tests, and can impart a <b>framework for studying for any test</b>, as well as ways to deal with the experience of preparing for and taking tests, which will translate well into future ‘high-stakes’ situations like <b>college or job interviews</b>. 
<br><br>
- I’m well-versed in the <b>‘strategic’ aspect</b> of test-taking. Some examples include:
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- How to adapt to an ‘adaptive’ test
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The game theory of guessing
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Management of time, emotions, and fatigue
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- (For reading tests) ‘Reading’ what kind of multiple-choice answer is most likely right
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- (For writing tests) ‘Reading’ the subjective graders for what they’re looking for
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- (For math tests) Focusing on getting right the long-form problems you know you can 
<br><br>
- As a human being, I recognize that the experience of school as stress and anxiety is largely due to classes being ‘taught to the test,’ and stress and anxiety therefore too often define the experience of those tests. The biggest difficulty on tests is not a failure to grasp the material, but a failure to remember it in time, due to some combination of <b>nerves and fatigue and poor motivation</b>. Test scores therefore respond even more positively to putting you in healthier and more relaxed state of mind, which is a great strength of mine as a tutor.

<i>Chris’s great strength as a test-prep instructor is that he understands what the College Board is looking for. He was able to convince my son he wasn’t really “selling out” by giving them what they wanted, or giving up by guessing. Refreshingly, Chris is also willing to learn from the rare occasions when he too can approach the question better.</i><br>
<div align="right">- Jen L., Bellevue</div><br><br>
<i>Chris raised my son’s math score by 150 points and gave him a better fundamental understanding of math at the same time. I no longer worry about how my son is going to do when he has to take a math course.</i><br>
<div align="right">- Todd P., Lynnwood</div><br><br>
<i>I hired Chris for my daughter (a junior at [a prestigious area prep school]) and her reading score went up by 100.
</i><br>
<div align="right">- Miko A., Seattle</div><br><br>
    <i>I scored 155 on my math practice test and panicked — I was a math major, and applying to Stats grad school! Chris tapped into the skills I thought I’d forgotten and I was able to get a score both I and my program were happy with.
</i><br>
<div align="right">- Allison W., Seattle</div><br><br>
      <i>An excellent alternative not just to the establishment choices, which just tested my daughter and spit her back up, as well as the disreputable “tutors” we thought we’d find on the Internet. The SAT is a big life event, and hiring the right tutor is an important choice. With Chris, we’re confident we made the right one.
