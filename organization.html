<font color="#000000" style="font-size:18px"><b>SPENDING TIME NOW TO SAVE A LOT OF TIME LATER</font></b>
<br><br>
Success in middle school, high school, college, and beyond, with all the flexibility that brings you, is more a matter of <b>wanting to succeed</b> than anything else — I have known hundreds of brilliant kids (most of them my peers) who just didn't want to deal with school, and many dullards who have gone to Harvard or Yale. This idea informs all of my tutoring and is close to the surface when I do test prep. My success raising test scores by approaching the test as a ‘game’ to be ‘solved’ inspired me to start offering small-group seminars on how to <b>get organized</b>, which are ideal for middle-schoolers and may also be my most informative and cost-effective classes for great kids struggling with school in a general sense.
<br><br>
Let me explain. The average student will tell you he ‘needs help with his algebra homework,’ and the average tutor will give him that kind of help, then wonder why the improvements either don’t last or don’t happen at all. This is because both student and tutor are <b>misunderstanding the problem</b>. The difficulties nearly all of my students face with school have so much more to do with the circumstances of school itself. It’s mainly a question of motivation.
<br><br>
And who wouldn’t experience a lack of motivation from time to time? School is always tiring and often stressful — and getting to do what you want to do in life, after all, seems incredibly remote from ‘memorizing some formulas for ninth-grade algebra.’ This is especially true for a middle- or high-schooler, and is even truer if that student’s aspirations (like most people’s) have little to do with algebra. These students are bright enough to know that school is a game. 
<br><br>
A good tutor can address the problem by teaching the thought process behind algebra, adumbrating real-life situations where algebra helps, and so on. But <b>a great tutor</b> will do that and show the student how something very specific and abstract – like algebra homework – is connected with the general notion of getting to spend your time and money how and with whom you want to spend them, and will teach them how to get from start to finish. For if a student is bright enough to learn that school is a game, he’s also bright enough to learn that playing the game – and playing it well – is worth his time.
<br><br>
This is what I do!
<br><br>
<b><font color="#000000" style="font-size:18px">CURRICULUM</font></b>
<br><br>
<i>‘Homework not getting done? Binder a mess? Student unmotivated? This workshop will address both the “can’t” and the “won’t” of school failure.’</i>
<br><br>
I teach sixth- through ninth-graders both how and why to get organized and deal with school. I <b>do not</b> employ empty, threatening, self-justifying rhetoric like ‘Because I said so’ or ‘Do you want to work at McDonald’s?’ or anything of the kind that kids hear way too often from their teachers, which I argue is responsible for their being unmotivated in the first place. I <b>do</b> use questions like ‘If you want to get a horse in the trailer, how do you do that?’ and ‘What do you think your options will be like at the end of high school if you put a, b or c amount of time into tasks x, y, and z?’ and ‘What do you think your English teacher is expecting from you on this assignment?’ to show my students that, while math homework may not <b>require creative thinking</b>, mastering school itself does.
<br><br>
I talk about options. I talk about managing stress. I talk about planning. I talk about investment and how working hard now means having the option to work less hard later. I talk about the power and limitation of personal choice. I talk about compromising with adults. I talk about how organizing an essay is similar to organizing a school day, which is similar to organizing a budget or making a long-term plan for your life. I talk about applying the skills you learn in school to college. I talk about college and income. I talk about how the two ideas of ‘class’ are related. 
<br><br>
Based on my experience, I talk about what I knew that made me a strong student when I was in middle and high school, and I talk about what I wish I’d known. I talk about how the point of school is discovering yourself, and not shutting yourself off from future opportunities that may help you further discover yourself. I talk, most of all, about how being able to deal with school means <b>being able to get what you want out of adults</b>, and (not quite as much) vice versa.
<br><br>
<b><font color="#000000" style="font-size:18px">FORMAT</font></b>
<br><br>
Ten one-hour sessions. $10 per session. No more than a dozen students. A local-branch library within walking distance from your secondary school, or, sometimes, my home and teaching space, in Northeast Seattle.
<br><br>
<b><font color="#000000" style="font-size:18px">SPECIFIC QUALIFICATIONS</font></b>
<br><br>
I graduated from Garfield with a 3.98 GPA (not quite one of the 40 or so valedictorians!) and finished my B.A. at Columbia, one of the most selective schools in the nation, <b>in three years</b>. I managed my education in such a way as to minimize stress, enabling me to both do as well as I wanted and devote the rest of my time to my interests, which is a luxury I want to offer my students.
<br><br>
I am proud to be self-employed by choice, and my youth and position in life make it far more plausible for me to ‘lead by example’ than nearly every public-school teacher, whose life is less happy and whose childhood is more distant. Every classroom teacher ought to be a <b>role model</b> of sorts, or at least someone to whom a moody adolescent can look up to, in some ways, but this is rarely the case. I’ll try to fill that role.
<br><br>
<b><font color="#000000" style="font-size:18px">SIGN UP RIGHT AWAY!</b></font>
<br><br>
<b>Call or e-mail me</b> if you’re interested in signing up, or contact your school’s counselor. I’m looking to expand to other locations in and around Seattle, especially to locations where there’s a great deal of interest.
<br><br>
A good class should be a <b>memorable experience</b>, nothing more, certainly nothing less.
<br><br>
<b><i>Individual rates available upon request.</i></b>

<i>This was the attitude adjustment my daughter (11 years old) needed, now she’s back on track at school and a much happier camper in general. Chris’s seminars and lessons have benefits beyond the classroom.
