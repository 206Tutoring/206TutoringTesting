<br><br>
(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYn-83jtq8l-vE9XBmDhaVg">Click here</a> to hear and see me play! In addition to teaching a sizable studio, I'm an active performer and will be uploading new videos regularly.)
<br><br>
<b>These are <i>not</i> your typical childhood piano lessons with grumpy old ladies!</b>
<br><br>    
I’ve been playing piano for sixteen years, studying under retired concert pianist Hiro Imamura. I can play a vast majority of the classical and Romantic repertoire — Beethoven, Brahms, Chopin, etc. — and much more! including my own arrangements of Lady Gaga, the <i>Game of Thrones</i> theme, and classic video-game music, to name a few. 
<br><br>
<b>I’d like to help you learn to play what you want to play, how you want to play it!</b>
<br><br>
Seattle is the <b>world capital of young classical musicians</b>. The Youth Symphony movement started here, and Garfield's orchestra is considered one of the best high school orchestras in the nation. When I was at Garfield, about a dozen students per year graduated and went to music school; admissions to Juilliard, New England Conservatory, Oberlin, Peabody, and so on, were not uncommon, for both classical or jazz musicians. However, most everybody else who played during high school quit as soon as they got to college! Why? 
<br><br>
There are two reasons. Most of the kids who quit after high school do so because they find their studies either not fun enough or too expensive. 
<br><br>
I can remedy both of these problems.
<br><br>
<b>My lessons are fun</b>. I love classical music — I have a deep familiarity with the orchestral and piano literature, and was an opera and symphony critic during college — and I can help you or love it too! I take a <b>light-hearted approach</b> towards things that will put you at ease. This doesn't mean you won't learn — quite the contrary! — it means that you'll be put in a better mindset to learn, since you'll have a great time coming to lessons and you'll want to practice. My piano teacher is my favorite educator of all time, because she taught me not just about the piano, but about life. I seek to emulate that. If a teacher’s piano lessons are stressful and no fun, then that teacher is missing the point. 
<br><br>
<b>My lessons are affordable</b>. My rate is well below the industry standard at expensive aggregators like Kennelly Keys and MusicWorks.

    <br><br>
<font color="#000000" style="font-size:18px"><b>ACCOMPANIMENT</b></font>
<br><br>
I’m also available as an accompanist. I've played with the <a href="http://www.garfieldorchestra.org/">Garfield Orchestra</a>, and accompanied for choirs and musicals. For chamber music, I've been called upon by numerous musicians for recitals and audition tapes, on instruments from the cello to the oboe. If you're looking for a dedicated and thorough pianist who can fit your rehearsal schedule, my rates are fairly low and my level of motivation high.
<br><br>
<font color="#000000" style="font-size:18px"><b>TEACHING AND PERFORMANCE QUALIFICATIONS</b></font>
<br><br>
I’m a <b><i>board member</i></b> of the <a href="http://seattlemta.org/">Seattle Music Teachers’ Association</a>, editing its monthly newsletter, <i>Staccato Notes</i>, and am listed in its member directory directory. I maintain a well-reviewed page on <a href="http://www.thumbtack.com/206-Tutoring-and-Piano-Lessons-Seattle-WA/service/860236">Thumbtack</a>.
<br><br>
All ages are welcome — I have experience teaching <b>everyone from ages 8 to 50</b>, but I do teach mainly teen and adult students. (For children, especially younger children, parental involvement makes all the difference.) All levels from beginner to strong intermediate are also welcome! I'm <b>classically trained</b> and sadly not qualified to teach jazz piano, but if jazz is what you're looking for, I'd be happy to refer you to someone I know and trust.
